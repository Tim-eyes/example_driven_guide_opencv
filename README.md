## Info
This repository is my study notes and referred codes, some parameters may be modified supporting by R.P. and image size.

The syllabus mainly includes **Basic Drawing**, **Image Processing**, **Histogram**, **Smoothing and Bluffing**, **Thresholding**, **Detection** and **Contours**. 
## Third-Parties Installation
In the Windows Command Prompt, type the following command to install packages:
```
pip install -r install_requir
```
> Note: The more specific algorithms can referred by [`scikit-image`](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/) (you may developed some rigor and understanding in the computer vision field)
## Usage
In your terminal:
```
python <PYTHON-SOURCE-FILE-PATH> [-i | --image] <IMAGE-SOURCE-FILE-PATH>
```
## Specific notebook

The last one is important, you should be able to type:
```
jupyter notebook
```
in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.

Try opening and running a notebook from the material to see check that it works.

This tutorial will be referred and grasped for fetching the project simply  
- [IPython](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)

Essential syntax for `jupyter` is below:
```
jupyter notebook [IPYNB-FILE-PATH]
```
